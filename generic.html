                            <h2>My Research Interests</h2>
                            <p>In my second year of college, I gravitated towards Data Analytics after a phenomenal internship experience. Based on my experience with a few personal projects, I realized that I could, in a way, address all the problems important to me. This would have been impossible to do had I stayed my course as a potential electronics engineer. Furthermore, the intersection of computational and mathematical methods seemed to have brought out the best in me. I genuinely enjoyed what I was doing. I have since been involved in projects and research spanning a myriad of domains!</p>
                            <p>Currently, I am interested in using behavioral insights of users on social media platforms to create more personalized solutions for safeguarding their mental health. For the amount of data they receive everyday, I strongly believe that these companies do very little beyond showing generic warnings with statements like "This post is sensitive".</p>
                            <p>So far, based on my research and professional experiences, I have used behavioral insights on the internet to generate marketable insights, and have conducted studies to monitor the mental health of people in a certain condition. This is just the tip of the iceberg. As a relatively inexperienced undergraduate, I have had to teach myself extensive subject matter in other domains such as psychology. I am confident that I can do the same in a much more effective way once I completely transition to data science. This is my motivation to conduct research in applied data science.</p>

                            <h2>The Time When I almost Launched a Startup, Almost :(</h2>
                            <p>In my third year as an undergraduate, I began to volunteer independently to local businesses in my area. Considering how only the MNC giants or well established chains in the country had access to any form of data processing infrastructure to make data-driven decisions, it further isolated the smaller, local businesses from keeping up. I reached out to nearby stores, creating dashboards for them based on their pre-existing records on MS Excel (Small businesses, Power BI and Tableau are too expensive or too complicated for their use). I also taught these business owners how they could change these dashboards based on their requirements. I also shared content that was available online if they felt curious. T</p>
                            <p> I had big plans for this. With a friend, we started expanding on this initiative, asking business owners for a testimonial if possible. Some of them were gracious enough to accept our requests. The plan was to create a non-profit organization with this intent, to expand operations, enable small businesses towards making data-driven decisions with the resource that would guide this century. Here is a testimonial I am proud of to this day!</p>
                            <div class="image main"><img src="images/motivation.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                            <p>We were planning to name this Non-Profit Organization "ME Analytica." Here's our logo:</p>
                            <div class="image main"><img src="images/startup.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
                            <p>However, this was not to last. Soon, the second wave of COVID-19 hit India massively. From having to recover, take care of my family, and of course, the lockdowns, I had to put this plan on hold. With further instrospection, I realized that this plan would not have taken off anyway. I felt that I required a more advanced skillset in math and development. Moreover, I did not have the network to go out and create a sustainable model for my idea. After completing my graduate studies, in the long term, I aspire to set up another organization that offers analytics as a service, offsetting the cost of a data analytics team for organizations, especially NGOs. I would like to onboard those willing to transition to a career in analytics, and those with a gap on their resume to help find better opportunities.</p>
